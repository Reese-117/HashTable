Overview
The HashTable.cpp program implements a hash table data structure in C++. The code demonstrates how to manage collisions, insert, search, and possibly delete elements using a hashing technique.

Features
Implementation of a hash table with basic operations.
Collision handling (e.g., linear probing, chaining).
Functions for insertion, search, and display of hash table contents.

Requirements
C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later (e.g., g++ or clang++).

Compilation
To compile the program, run:
g++ -std=c++11 -o HashTable HashTable.cpp

Running
After compilation, run the executable:

./HashTable

Notes
Review the source code comments for details on collision handling and table resizing.
Useful as a learning tool for data structure implementations in C++.
